## Plan on improving the project

There are several things in this project that I would like to improve on personally. One of my main struggles was figuring out how to position the paragraphs in the about section. I tried my best to position it with margins. I feel like there could be a more precise way to do it and I would like to come back and see if I can figure it out.
